# Kubernetes Training

This training material was developed internal to Sealingtech for approximately a four hour class.  The goal of this class was to give student's an introduction to the Docker and Kubernetes pipeline.  By the end of the class, students will have built and deployed a multi-tier web application.

Our material is organized as:

Docs - Interactive labs which step students through building containers
Docker - All Docker files that required for Student's to build
Kubernetes - All the Kubernetes YAML files to deploy containers
Presentation - Supporting explanation material
